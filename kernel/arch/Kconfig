config HAVE_STACKPROTECTOR
	bool
	help
	  An arch should select this symbol if:
	  - it has implemented a stack canary (e.g. __stack_chk_guard)

config CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE
	def_bool $(cc-option,-fno-stack-protector)

config STACKPROTECTOR
	bool "Stack Protector buffer overflow detection"
	depends on HAVE_STACKPROTECTOR
	depends on $(cc-option,-fstack-protector)
	default y
	help
	  This option turns on the "stack-protector" GCC feature. This
	  feature puts, at the beginning of functions, a canary value on
	  the stack just before the return address, and validates
	  the value just before actually returning.  Stack based buffer
	  overflows (that need to overwrite this return address) now also
	  overwrite the canary, which gets detected and the attack is then
	  neutralized via a kernel panic.

	  Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added if they
	  have an 8-byte or larger character array on the stack.

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.2 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector").

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to
	  about 3% of all kernel functions, which increases kernel code size
	  by about 0.3%.

config STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
	bool "Strong Stack Protector"
	depends on STACKPROTECTOR
	depends on $(cc-option,-fstack-protector-strong)
	default y
	help
	  Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added in any
	  of the following conditions:

	  - local variable's address used as part of the right hand side of an
	    assignment or function argument
	  - local variable is an array (or union containing an array),
	    regardless of array type or length
	  - uses register local variables

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.9 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector-strong").

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to
	  about 20% of all kernel functions, which increases the kernel code
	  size by about 2%.

config ARCH_WANT_LD_ORPHAN_WARN
	bool
	help
	  An arch should select this symbol once all linker sections are explicitly
	  included, size-asserted, or discarded in the linker scripts. This is
	  important because we never want expected sections to be placed heuristically
	  by the linker, since the locations of such sections can change between linker
	  versions.

config HAVE_ARCH_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_PUD
	bool

config HAVE_ARCH_HUGE_VMAP
