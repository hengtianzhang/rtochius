# CROSS_COMPILE is a KBuild mechanism for specifying an external
# toolchain with a single environment variable.
#
# It is a legacy mechanism that will in rtochius translate to
# specififying RTOCHIUS_TOOLCHAIN to 'cross-compile' with the location
# 'CROSS_COMPILE'.
#
# It can be set from either the environment or from a CMake variable
# of the same name.
#
# The env var has the lowest precedence.
