config ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP
       bool
       help
	 Modern versions of GCC (since 4.4) have builtin functions
	 for handling byte-swapping. Using these, instead of the old
	 inline assembler that the architecture code provides in the
	 __arch_bswapXX() macros, allows the compiler to see what's
	 happening and offers more opportunity for optimisation. In
	 particular, the compiler will be able to combine the byteswap
	 with a nearby load or store and use load-and-swap or
	 store-and-swap instructions if the architecture has them. It
	 should almost *never* result in code which is worse than the
	 hand-coded assembler in <asm/swab.h>.  But just in case it
	 does, the use of the builtins is optional.

	 Any architecture with load-and-swap or store-and-swap
	 instructions should set this. And it shouldn't hurt to set it
	 on architectures that don't have such instructions.

config HAVE_ARCH_COMPILER_H
	bool
	help
	  An architecture can select this if it provides an
	  asm/compiler.h header that should be included after
	  base/compiler-*.h in order to override macro definitions that those
	  headers generally provide.

config HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	bool
	help
	  Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned accesses
	  without the use of get_unaligned/put_unaligned. Others are
	  unable to perform such accesses efficiently (e.g. trap on
	  unaligned access and require fixing it up in the exception
	  handler.)

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if it can
	  perform unaligned accesses efficiently to allow different
	  code paths to be selected for these cases. Some network
	  drivers, for example, could opt to not fix up alignment
	  problems with received packets if doing so would not help
	  much.

	  See Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt for more
	  information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.
